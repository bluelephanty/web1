The coronavirus stock market rally had a strong performance last week. The Nasdaq and growth stocks soared to highs even as coronavirus cases ramp up. Megacaps Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) continue to rise sharply, while Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix stock surged.</p>

  <p>Netflix (NFLX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are among the notable companies kicking off earnings season, with Domino's stock entering a buy zone Friday. Meanwhile, Tesla cut the price of its Model Y crossover by $3,000, bringing the base version to $49,900. It's a sign of possible weak demand for the brand-new Tesla Model Y. Late Friday, Tesla set its annual shareholder meeting and Battery Day for Sept. 22.</p>
